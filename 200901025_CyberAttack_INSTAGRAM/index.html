            <p>
            <h4 class="h4">In today's digital age, social media has become an integral part of our lives. We share
              personal information, images, and videos on these platforms every day, making them vulnerable to cyber
              attacks. In 2020, a major cyber attack on social media giants Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube left nearly
              235 million profiles unprotected without any passwords, which could have devastating consequences for
              those affected.
              In this blog post, we'll explore what happened during the attack, how it affected Instagram users, and
              what steps can be taken to protect your own account.
            </h4><br>
            <h2>
              <k><a class="h2">What happened during the attack?</a></k>
            </h2>
            <h4 class="h4">The cyber attack was discovered by cybersecurity researchers who found a database containing
              over 235 million user profiles that had been exposed to the internet without any password protection. The
              database contained a wealth of personal information, including usernames, email addresses, phone numbers,
              profile pictures, and more. The scale of the breach was enormous, and the potential consequences for those
              affected were serious. The attack was first discovered when users began reporting that they were unable to
              access their accounts. It was quickly discovered that the hackers had managed to gain access to a number
              of accounts by exploiting a vulnerability in the platform's API. The hackers were then able to change the
              email addresses and phone numbers associated with the accounts, effectively locking out the legitimate
              owners.The attackers then used the compromised accounts to launch a coordinated scam campaign, which
              involved posting messages that encouraged users to send cryptocurrency to a specific wallet address. The
              messages were often accompanied by photos of the account owner, which added an element of authenticity to
              the scam.The attack affected a wide range of accounts, with many high-profile users including Elon Musk,
              Jeff Bezos, and Barack Obama being targeted. In total, it's believed that over 100 accounts were
              compromised. The researchers found that the database was being hosted on a server located in the United
              States, and the data appeared to have been collected over a period of several years. They also found that
              the database was being sold on the dark web for a significant sum of money, indicating that it was likely
              being used for nefarious purposes. The companies affected by the breach, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube,
              were quick to respond, with Instagram releasing a statement saying that they were investigating the matter
              and taking steps to protect their users. TikTok and YouTube also issued statements, assuring their users
              that they were taking the matter seriously and working to mitigate the impact of the breach. The incident
              highlights the need for stronger cybersecurity measures on social media platforms, and the importance of
              users taking steps to protect their personal information. It is essential that companies take steps to
              secure their databases and protect the information of their users, and that users take steps to protect
              themselves by using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication. In this blog post, we will
              delve deeper into the cyber attack on Instagram in 2020, discussing the methods used by cybercriminals,
              the potential consequences for affected users, and the steps companies and users can take to prevent
              similar incidents in the future. The Method Used by Cybercriminals Cybercriminals use a variety of methods
              to gain access to user accounts and databases, including phishing attacks, malware, and social engineering
              tactics. In the case of the 2020 cyber attack on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, it is not clear how the
              cybercriminals gained access to the database. However, it is likely that they used a form of social
              engineering, such as a spear-phishing attack, to trick an employee of one of the companies into providing
              them with access to the database. Spear-phishing is a targeted form of phishing attack that involves
              sending an email or message to a specific individual, often posing as someone they know or trust, and
              attempting to trick them into revealing sensitive information. Alternatively, the cybercriminals may have
              exploited a vulnerability in the database software or used a brute-force attack to guess the passwords
              used to access the database. A brute-force attack is a method of guessing passwords by trying every
              possible combination until the correct one is found. The Consequences for Affected Users The consequences
              of the cyber attack on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube in 2020 could be severe for those whose personal
              information was exposed. The database contained a wealth of information, including usernames, email
              addresses, phone numbers, profile pictures, and more. This information could be used by cybercriminals to
              conduct phishing attacks, identity theft, or other forms of cybercrime. For example, cybercriminals could
              use the information to send targeted phishing emails or messages to users, posing as a trusted entity and
              attempting to trick them into revealing sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link. In
              addition, the information could be used for identity theft, where cybercriminals use the personal
              information of others to open bank accounts, apply for loans, or make fraudulent purchases.</h4><br>

              width="250" class="blog-banner-img">
            <h4 class="h4">For those whose accounts were compromised, the attack was a major inconvenience. Many were
              unable to access their accounts for several days, and some had to go through a lengthy process to regain
              control. Additionally, the attack exposed the personal information of some users, such as email addresses
              and phone numbers.The attack also had wider implications for Instagram users as a whole. It highlighted
              the vulnerability of the platform to cyber attacks, and raised questions about the effectiveness of
              Instagram's security measures. The attack also served as a warning to users to be more vigilant about the
              security of their accounts, and to take steps to protect themselves against future attacks.</h4><br>

            <h4 class="h4">There are several steps that can be taken to help protect your Instagram account from cyber
              attacks:</h4><br>
            <h2><a class="h2">Use a strong, unique password: </a></h2>
            <h4 class="h4">This is the first and most important step in securing your account. Your password should be
              complex and unique to Instagram, and should not be used for any other online accounts.Enable two-factor
              authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a
              code in addition to your password to log in. This can prevent attackers from gaining access to your
              account, even if they manage to obtain your password.</h4><br>
            <h2><a class="h2">Be wary of suspicious messages and links: </a></h2>
            <h4 class="h4">Scammers often use phishing attacks to trick users into giving away their login credentials.
              Be wary of messages that ask you to click on links or provide personal information.Keep your app and
              device up to date: Instagram regularly releases updates that address security vulnerabilities. Make sure
              you're using the latest version of the app and keep your device up to date with the latest security
              patches.</h4><br>
            <h2><a class="h2">Monitor your account activity: </a></h2>
            <h4 class="h4">Keep an eye on your account activity and be on the lookout for any suspicious activity. If
              you notice anything out of the ordinary, change your password immediately and report the incident to
              Instagram.
              Meanwhile, all the users of TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube should be alert to email phishing scams or
              scams related to posting as comments on social media. All the organizations having databases on the cloud
              should definitely audit the access permissions to ensure that the database is not accessible by everyone.
              Most importantly, do not share any sensitive data through social media platforms.
            </h4><br>
            <h2>
              <k><a class="h2">Is This Data Breach A Hack? </a></k>
            </h2>
            <h4 class="h4">It is common to consider this a hack, however, it is not. The web scraping practice involves
              collecting data from different web pages in an automated way. It accesses only public data. But, social
              media firms usually do not encourage this to ensure user data protection. However, a plethora of data
              analytics firms leverages this practice to generate a huge database. Most of these companies also derive
              useful insights from these data and sell them to other firms in exchange for money.
              We can witness a profusion of reports regarding user profile-related data flashing on dark web cybercrime
              avenue. From 100,000 data breaches paving a way to steal 15 million logins to the current incident of 235
              million data being revealed for free. So, if you think all of these profiles will get hacked, you are
              wrong. But, these profiles are comparatively more vulnerable and the hackers might try their hands on
              certain user profiles.

            <h2>
              <k><a class="h2">A Database Of 235 Million User Information Without Password Protection </a></k>
            </h2>
            <img src="./assets/images/insta4.png" alt="Building a Restful CRUD API with Node JS, Express, and MongoDB"
              width="250" class="blog-banner-img">
            <h4 class="h4">The report says that the scraped data of over 235 million users were collated into a
              database, which was surprisingly not password protected. This was brought to light by Bob Diachenko and
              his fellow researchers, working for Comparitech. They identified three identical copies of the said
              database on the 1st of August. Besides, they found that the data belonged to a firm named Deep Social.
              However, when the company was contacted, the request was sent to Social Data, a Hong-Kong-based company.
              Social Data acknowledged the data breach and managed to restrict the access to the humongous database,
              although they denied any relationship with Deep Social. The web scraped data encompassed four major data
              sets with the details of all 235 million users including their names, age, gender, profile photo, and the
              number of followers they all had. This data is often used by hackers to perform phishing and spam
              campaigns. Hence, social media companies have to frame stringent policies to ensure their database
              security. </h4><br>
            <h2>
              <k><a class="h2">Conclusion</a></k>
            </h2>
            <h4 class="h4">The cyber attack on Instagram in 2020 highlighted the importance of taking steps to secure
              your social media accounts. By using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being
              vigilant about suspicious activity, you can help protect yourself against future attacks. Stay safe
